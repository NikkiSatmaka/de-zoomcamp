ðŸš€ Lesson 1 Highlights at Data Engineering Zoomcamp by @DataTalksClub ðŸš€

For the first lesson at DE Zoomcamp, we learned about containerization, SQL, and infrastructure as a code

I've worked with docker and SQL but using terraform is fairly new to me and it's pretty amazing
Provisioning cloud resources declaratively felt like a breeze

Amidst the full-packed work week, I'm glad I was able to pack these lessons to my head
